    "Temporal is a durable execution platform that enables developers to build scalable applications without sacrificing productivity or reliability. It allows you to write your business logic as code in the form of Temporal Workflows, which automatically capture state at every step. This means that in the event of failure, the workflows can pick up exactly where they left off. The Temporal service handles executing these workflows resiliently, managing retries, task queues, signals, and timers to ensure the application logic runs to completion even in the face of failures.\n\nIn summary, Temporal helps in managing distributed state and running reliable, scalable cloud applications by persisting the state of workflows and automatically handling failures and retries.",
    "Ambient agents are intelligent AI systems that operate continuously in the background, monitoring streams of events, data, user interactions, and system events. They make decisions and act proactively without waiting for direct human prompting. These agents are event-driven and work to automate processes by perceiving context and driving intelligent automation in dynamic environments. They help organizations shift from reactive, manually driven operations to proactive and intelligent automation, delivering faster responses, higher accuracy, and improved service quality. \n\nIn essence, ambient agents are always-on, continuously running AI systems that take action as soon as the business or environment requires it, enabling smarter and more efficient automation.",

    "Interrupts in LangGraph are mechanisms used to pause the execution of a graph while preserving its state indefinitely. LangGraph uses its persistence layer to save the graph state, allowing the execution to be paused and later resumed from the point it was interrupted. This is achieved because LangGraph checkpoints the graph state after each step, enabling the system to save the execution context and continue the workflow without losing progress.\n\nThere are two types of interrupts:\n1. Dynamic interrupts: These pause the graph execution from within a specific node, based on the current state of the graph.\n2. Static interrupts: These pause the graph at predefined points, either before or after a node executes (interrupt_before and interrupt_after).\n\nThis feature supports scenarios like asynchronous human review or input without any time constraints, making the graph execution flexible. The state is safely persisted using a checkpointer, and the graph can be resumed anytime with the right configuration.\n\nInterrupts are also used in contexts such as customer support bots, where execution can be paused during sensitive operations that modify data, but the bot can handle simple queries autonomously without interruption. Additionally, checkpointing associated with interrupts provides fault tolerance and error recovery by allowing the graph to restart from the last successful step in case of failures.\n\nFor more detailed examples and usage, you can refer to LangGraph's documentation on interrupts and persistence.",
    "LangGraph implements a streaming system to surface real-time updates, allowing for responsive and transparent user experiences. This streaming system lets you surface live feedback from graph runs to your app. There are three main categories of data you can stream:\n\n1. Workflow progress — get state updates after each graph node is executed.\n2. LLM tokens — stream language model tokens as they’re generated.\n3. Custom updates — emit user-defined signals (e.g., “Fetched 10/100 records”).\n\nThis enables you to have live and dynamic interactions by showing real-time progress and outputs to the users. For more detailed guidance, you can visit the LangGraph streaming overview page at https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/.",
    "Multi-agent systems consist of multiple smaller, independent agents that work together to manage complex applications. Each agent uses a large language model (LLM) to decide the control flow and can be as simple as a prompt and an LLM call or as complex as a ReAct agent. These systems help address issues such as managing an agent with too many tools, handling complex context, and requiring multiple specialized areas (e.g., planner, researcher, math expert). \n\nThe primary benefits of using multi-agent systems include:\n- Modularity: Separate agents make it easier to develop, test, and maintain.\n- Specialization: Expert agents can focus on specific domains for better performance.\n- Control: Explicit control over how agents communicate.\n\nMulti-agent systems thus facilitate better management, scalability, and specialization in complex applications. \n\nSource: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/",
    "To add human-in-the-loop, human involvement can significantly enhance agent reliability, especially for sensitive tasks. This process usually involves adding human intervention at critical points in the workflow where automated decisions need verification or input by a human expert.\n\nIn LangGraph, adding human-in-the-loop typically means you design your agent or system to request a human to review, approve, or provide additional information before proceeding with certain actions or decisions. This helps to ensure accuracy, reliability, and safety by combining automation with human judgment.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the human-in-the-loop concept overview on LangGraph's documentation pages. If you would like, I can help you with specific steps or code examples related to adding human-in-the-loop.",
